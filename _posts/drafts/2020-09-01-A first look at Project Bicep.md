title: A first look at Project Bicep ðŸ’ª - an ARM DSL!
---

I received a DM on Twitter this morning with a link to a repo on Github, https://github.com/Azure/bicep, Project Bicep. At that point I knew I had to cancel all my plans for the morning to be able to focus the rest of the day. The README.md had shifted my focus elsewhere and I just had to try it out!

What is Bicep?
-----
I'm not going to go into detail about what Bicep is, the repository is well structured and packed with all the info you need to get started. The README states the following:

```Bicep is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources declaratively. It aims to drastically simplify the authoring experience with a cleaner syntax and better support for modularity and code re-use. Bicep is a transparent abstraction over ARM and ARM templates, which means anything that can be done in an ARM Template can be done in bicep (outside of temporary known limitations). All resource types, apiVersions, and properties that are valid in an ARM template are equally valid in Bicep on day one.```

Here's everything you need to get started writing Bicep:

 * [Setup your bicep development environment](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/blob/master/docs/installing.md)
* [Step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/blob/master/docs/tutorial/01-simple-template.md)
* [Bicep Playground](https://bicepdemo.z22.web.core.windows.net/) (Love this! â™¥)
